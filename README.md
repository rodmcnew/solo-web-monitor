# SoloWebMonitor

This is a simple stand alone web uptime monitor. It will watch any URLs you give it and will let you know if they go down. You can run this app locally or on a server. The only thing that is required is NodeJS. No database is required.

This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

```

## Run the application

```

You can also run `node .` to skip the build step.
