# Solo Web Monitor

Try the demo at https://solo-web-monitor.herokuapp.com/. The demo may take 60 seconds to first load because it is on a free Heroku instance.

This is a simple stand alone web uptime monitor. It will watch any URLs you give it and will let you know if they go down. You can run this app locally or on a server. The only thing that is required is NodeJS. No database is required.

## Solo Web Monitor is built on top of:
- TypeScript for client and server
- React functional components
- Redux Toolkit
- Loopback 4 Node.js server framework
